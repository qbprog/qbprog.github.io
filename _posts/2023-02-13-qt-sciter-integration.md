Just for information, I recently published a [small repository](https://github.com/QbProg/qtsciter) containing a Qt 6.x integration for the Sciter component.

[Sciter](https://sciter.com/) is a nice cross platform "Embeddable HTML/CSS/JavaScript engine". It is not FOSS but has affordable licenses and commercial source-access.

Have fun!

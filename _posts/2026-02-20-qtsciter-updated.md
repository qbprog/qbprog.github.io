I just pushed (@ https://github.com/qbprog/qtsciter) an update that supports Sciter 6.x (which changed a few integration options).

The update is tested on VS2026 and Qt 6.10.2, but it should support any Qt and VS version.

I even update a bit the HiDPI support and made sure it works when changing screens.
